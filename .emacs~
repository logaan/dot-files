;; * This enables the database and idle reparse engines
;;(semantic-load-enable-minimum-features)

;; * This enables some tools useful for coding, such as summary mode
;;   imenu support, and the semantic navigator
(semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)

;; * This enables even more coding tools such as the nascent intellisense mode
;;   decoration mode, and stickyfunc mode (plus regular code helpers)
;; (semantic-load-enable-guady-code-helpers)

;; * This turns on which-func support (Plus all other code helpers)
;; (semantic-load-enable-excessive-code-helpers)

;; This turns on modes that aid in grammar writing and semantic tool
;; development.  It does not enable any other features such as code
;; helpers above.
